      <description>Julia and Emacs Julia is a hot upcoming language. I see nothing but support for it online, and many benchmarks showing a notable improvements over Python or R. The main reason why it is not already rivaling Python or R is the framework and packages. The language is still new, and does not have a mature framework. Even though it is now on the stable v1.4, there are features I&amp;rsquo;ve seen described as as &amp;lsquo;in development&amp;rsquo;.</description>
