      <description>This is a quick run-down of how I set up lightbox2 for my hugo site. To be honest, it is my personal documentation to the shortcode written by Julian Stier in his blog-post about lightbox2. His post helped me deal with a number of problems using lightbox2 with hugo when the main lightbox2 tutorial had failed me. This will be a post under constant development as I work out lightbox2 and to remind myself how to implement it.</description>
