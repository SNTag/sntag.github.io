      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new project: using a Raspberry Pi to create a timelapse on a DSLR. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved to Binghamton NY, and from my 8th floor apartment, I have an amazing view of rolling hills. In the morning, clouds cover the summits. Preludes to rain drape the sky in rolling whites and greys. But I can&amp;rsquo;t communicate any of this to my parents back in Singapore, and while words could paint a picture, an actual picture is worth a 1000 words.</description>

      <title>Lightbox2 in hugo</title>

      <description>This is a quick run-down of how I set up lightbox2 for my hugo site. To be honest, it is my personal documentation to the shortcode written by Julian Stier in his blog-post about lightbox2. His post helped me deal with a number of problems using lightbox2 with hugo when the main lightbox2 tutorial had failed me. This will be a post under constant development as I work out lightbox2 and to remind myself how to implement it.</description>

      <title>Generating custom raspberry-pi images</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a number of projects involving my raspberry pi; DSLR timelapse, a pi running dedicated stocks and notifications systems, and a media server. I have a silly approach of solving any critical errors by flashing a new raspbian image to the SD card and continuing as if the error was never made. The approach can be heavily criticized, but I&amp;rsquo;m not invested in immediately working out the errors; it&amp;rsquo;s usually something obscure.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve begun creating a media server lately. Something that I never thought I would attempt. With the number of relatively comprehensive streaming services, a media server did not make much sense. Not to mention my ptsd thinking back to my teenage years of terrible data-handling. I would create inumerable backups with minute differences, making it impossible to realize which one was the proper backup when needed. I&amp;rsquo;m still surprised today by some backup hidden deep in my file systems.</description>

      <description>Oddly enough, I’ve been hearing a lot about tidymodels this week, from reddit to youtube. Plus, the tidytuesday dataset this week looks fun.I figure I’ll spend a tidytuesday trying to figure out this new and in-development machine-learning package.
For the newcomer, tidymodels is the planned replacement for the caret package. Complicated machine learning (ml) models will continue using caret for a while as tidymodels is very new to the field.</description>

      <title>Getting Back into Piano</title>

      <description>During this quarantine period, it seems as though there are fewer jobs and more applicants than ever before. So between my coursera courses and job applications, I’m taking the time to try my hand at the piano again. Not that I stopped, it’s been on and off for a long time. I just did not have as much interest at mastering it before. The timing for my new-found interest is unfortunate…my piano has been neglected from my on-and-off interest, with keys towards both ends often getting stuck, or off-tune.</description>

      <title>Getting Emacs and Julia to work</title>

      <description>Julia and Emacs Julia is a hot upcoming language. I see nothing but support for it online, and many benchmarks showing a notable improvements over Python or R. The main reason why it is not already rivaling Python or R is the framework and packages. The language is still new, and does not have a mature framework. Even though it is now on the stable v1.4, there are features I&amp;rsquo;ve seen described as as &amp;lsquo;in development&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>2020: My non-New Years Resolution</title>

      <description>On 31st Dec, 2019, I was sitting in Kolkata, India, on the lawn of the Kolkata Club.  In front was a stage, musicians and DJs from bollywood.  Around me were relatives and family, ready to celebrate the New Years with a big dinner and lots of musical entertainment.  And for all the excitment around me, it felt like any other New Years. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAFnby2184o][John Oliver]] said it well when he described New Years as &amp;lsquo;/The &lt;em&gt;Worst&lt;/em&gt;!/&#39;.  My track record hasn&amp;rsquo;t been great with New Years.  For all the hype we put on New Year, New Me, we end up falling back into the same habits.  So ironically, I came up with a goal on New Years to spite to all my failed New Years resolution; to write 1-2 scripts a week for a year in any programming language.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 2020, Oct 16 I stopped trying to modify my kobo ereader a long while back. When I started the project, I was enjoy a ready access to nearby libraries and the joys of physical books. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to find that there is room for the Kobo in my library, especially for the heavier books like Les Miserable and The Count of Monte Cristo that are just too big to carry around.</description>

      <title>My plan for a CRISPR-KO library and scRNA-seq</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER I assume that you have working knowledge of vectors (plasmids) used in molecular biology, and know what an RNA or sgRNA is. Anything else is not important or will be explained.
My master&amp;rsquo;s thesis will be published soon on the NUS scholar&amp;rsquo;s bank. While I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do, the wet lab side of the work almost broke me! For instance, an image in the thesis showing a western blot of DLG5 Knock-Out (KO) took almost 3 months of work.</description>

      <description>About the blog This blog will be a record of projects completed both professionally and in my spare time. It will be about programming, my discoveries, and biology. I started this blog to figure out static web programming. It&amp;rsquo;s a little something that&amp;rsquo;s still developing into something else.
Commenting system You will only be able to comment on this site if you have a github account. Github isn&amp;rsquo;t something that everyone is registered to, but getting comments to work as it is took a decent amount of trial and error.</description>
