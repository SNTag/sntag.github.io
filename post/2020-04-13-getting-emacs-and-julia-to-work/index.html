		<h1 id="julia-and-emacs">Julia and Emacs</h1>
<p>Julia is a hot upcoming language. I see nothing but support for it online, and many benchmarks showing a notable improvements over Python or R. The main reason why it is not already rivaling Python or R is the framework and packages. The language is still new, and does not have a mature framework. Even though it is now on the stable v1.4, there are features I&rsquo;ve seen described as as &lsquo;in development&rsquo;. The packages are also maturing, and I can find many equivalent packages to those I use a biologist. However, I will admit a certain level of distrust until I understand Julia better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to play with this language, but the biggest obstacle is the IDE. My Emacs config
is something that I&rsquo;ve grown very attached to, and I&rsquo;m not going to use any other if I have
to. Unfortunately, nearly all of the packages I found for Emacs+Julia have not been worked on for 3 years
or more. I suspect that Emacs support for the language will not be great for a while. The best hope for anyone is to use
ESS, which has active support for Julia.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The best implementation of Julia that I have achieved is ESS+Jupyter. This approach has created a
stable environment with all of the features I rely on; autocompletion, access to a shell, access to
documentation. Plus, while org-babel is unavailable, I can add literate notes to my experiments in
Julia!</p>
<p>For anyone interested, a simplified version of my config<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="color:#75715e">;; ====================</span>

<span style="color:#75715e">;;</span>
<span style="color:#75715e">;; This is a very simplified version of my config.</span>
(use-package ess
  :mode (
         (<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\\.jl\\&#39;&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">.</span> ess-mode)
         (<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\\.R\\&#39;&#34;</span>  <span style="color:#f92672">.</span> ess-mode)
         (<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\\.r\\&#39;&#34;</span>  <span style="color:#f92672">.</span> ess-mode)
	 )
  )

</code></pre></div><p>When starting the terminal using this approach, you might get the message &ldquo;Terminal not
functional&rdquo;. According to a <a href="https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/issues/143">github issue</a>, the system
is just upset about a missing history file.</p>
<p>As a little extra, Manjaro users may have had issues with downloading packages through Julia. Add this line to your Bashrc/Zshrc, and it should be fixed:</p>
<p><code>export JULIA_PKG_SERVER=pkg.julialang.org</code></p>
<h1 id="summary-of-this-approach">Summary of this approach</h1>
<h2 id="positives">Positives:</h2>
<p>-Adds ESS support to Julia. This adds a large number of features that currently lack from any other competitors.
-Adds jupyter support through <a href="https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook">EIN</a>, enabling literate programming.
-Source-editing will now have auto-complete for julia.
-Stable enough to get you going!</p>
<h2 id="negatives">negatives:</h2>
<p>-No org-mode for now&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to reach out to me about this post, please leave an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/sntag/sntag.github.io/issues">github repo</a>. I will get around to setting up a comments system for a static website eventually.</p>
<h2 id="discontinued-packages-for-julia-that-i-had-found-in-case-your-interested">discontinued packages for Julia that I had found (in case your interested)</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dennisog/julia-shell-mode">Julia-shell</a>: seemed promising, but was last updated in 2016 as of writing. That was before the
release of v1. Considering the issues and level of maturity that &lt;v1 Julia had, I&rsquo;m not keen on
testing this shell&rsquo;s stability.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gjkerns/ob-julia/blob/master/ob-julia-doc.org">ob-julia</a>: Org-mode support for Julia also seem discontinued. This was also written before v1. It
may be worth playing with if I can get Julia and org to work. I&rsquo;ll update this post in the future
once I figure out how to get org-babel working with Julia.</li>

<p>My full config can be found <a href="https://github.com/SNTag/.dotfiles/tree/master/emacs-26.2">here</a>. The folder &lsquo;Borg-Collective-Emacs&rsquo; has each of my major modes separated into individual el files. And yes, the name Borg is a star trek reference.
