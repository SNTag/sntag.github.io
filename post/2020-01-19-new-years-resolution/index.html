		<p><strong>UPDATE on 2020, May 6th</strong>: My github repo for my New Years resolution will not be as heavily developed going forward. I&rsquo;ve started working on things that are personalized ways of approaching problems (making my own packages, reiterations of previous scripts, just a general mess). Plus, I&rsquo;m working on my github etiquette. I&rsquo;ve been approaching github as a storage repository for nearly any code. I plan to only commit code I am proud of moving forward.</p>
<p>On 31st Dec, 2019, I was sitting in Kolkata, India, on the lawn of the Kolkata Club.  In front was a stage, musicians and DJs from bollywood.  Around me were relatives and family, ready to celebrate the New Years with a big dinner and lots of musical entertainment.  And for all the excitment around me, it felt like any other New Years. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAFnby2184o][John Oliver]] said it well when he described New Years as &lsquo;/The <em>Worst</em>!/'.  My track record hasn&rsquo;t been great with New Years.  For all the hype we put on New Year, New Me, we end up falling back into the same habits.  So ironically, I came up with a goal on New Years to spite to all my failed New Years resolution; to write 1-2 scripts a week for a year in any programming language.</p>
<p>In essence, I&rsquo;m just rebranding the 100 Days of Coding.  I&rsquo;ve failed the 100 DoC previously as one of my New Years resolution.  I felt like I was too occupied as a grad student to spend time every day writing potentially irrelevant code.  And to be honest, I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out what I would code on a daily bases, it just didn&rsquo;t feel like me.  Being a year old, I think I&rsquo;ve found a goal that I <em>do</em> have motivation for.  Admittedly, this goal is to get a list of scripts or features that I would like to have available on my computer.</p>
<p>So Here&rsquo;s the plan.  For each week, I&rsquo;m going to assign myself a script that would improve my PC experience.  For the first week, I wrote a script that would sort my photos into folders by year, then city or event.  Suddenly my side-hobby of photography and photo-trail became a low-effort addition to my life.  For the second week, I worked on writing a Sudoku script in PyQt5.  I&rsquo;m not a Sudoku player and don&rsquo;t plan to be, but knowledge in PyQt5 will let me eventually add a GUI interface to my photo sorting script.  I have other ideas that I think would help me out professionally and personally.  Most of them are probably already available on github in some form or the other, but to heck with those systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>A boiler-plate latex document generator
Using a GUI, by selecting checkboxes, a latex document will be made with pre-rendered code.  It would be a fun way to interact and potentially customize my latex experience.</li>
<li>Terminal Clock/Alarm system
There were several times during my master&rsquo;s degree where I just couldn&rsquo;t find a timer&hellip;Nearly all of my devices have a terminal, and I could use an elaborate terminal/clock alarm.</li>
<li>An org/shell Calendar reminder system
In my attempts to get organized, I have adopted Org for my professional scheduling.  However, I only get notifications from org-journals on my phone.  A better solution would be to have a script capable of reading my org-journal and give notifications when needed.</li>
<li>Financial data-keeping
I keep an eye on the market. I was part of an Investment club in undergrad, and I need a system to alert me of changes. However, I do not care to know the details of the market minute to minute, it just needs to update me on major swings.</li>
<li>Personal packages
It would be great to have personal scripts for the stuff I do often.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a ton of ideas I would love to slowly work towards.  I&rsquo;m interested in eventually working towards some sort of PyTorch application, an AI that would solve the games I make, and more.  Lets see what this 2020 has in store with my /non/-New Years resolution.</p>
